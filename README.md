### Hello how are you? I'm Amanda, Junior Web Developer in the learning process. I am currently graduating from UNIFEBE in Information Systems. I participated in the Young Programmer Program at Senac and worked as a Vtex development intern at HÃ­brido. My knowledge is focused on Front-end and my heart belongs to this area, however, I really want to understand more about Back-end and how everything works behind the screen.
